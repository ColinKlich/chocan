    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            For Project 1, our group focused on the ChocAn software. This software handles everything, including verifying members, tracking member activity, organizing fees, and updating member records. Every individual on team 13 was tasked to produce a group file "Report.html" as well as submit a personal html file. Our group split up the necessary tasks to ensure equal participation for fairness and efficiency. Work was divided to have one person handle the Paragraph, one person handle the Glossary, and the rest handle the Use Case Definitions. After a task is complete, we move on to help with another task. The project also required every member to create their own Use Case Diagram, which allowed use to produce the best possible diagram for our final "Report.html". As mentioned earlier, we have provided Use Case Descriptions and a Glossary to further elaborate on our Use Case Diagram. This is featured in "Report.html".
