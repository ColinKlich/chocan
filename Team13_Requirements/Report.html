    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In Project 1, our primary focus centered on the development of data processing software tailored to the needs of Chocoholics Anonymous, an organization dedicated to helping people addicted to chocolate. It's important to emphasize that our project scope intentionally excluded the development of communication software, terminal design, and the intricacies of managing payments between members and providers. With the exception of the project submitter, every team member has contributed an HTML file housing their respective use case diagram and team-related information. This concerted effort ensures a unified understanding of the project's content, with Caleb Dochow taking the role of the project submitter.

In regards to our glossary, we took painstaking measures to meticulously define and clarify terms, drawing insights from both the Chocoholics Anonymous documentation and our collaborative Use Case Diagram. This diagram was a product of joint efforts, synthesizing input and insights from all group members. To access the Use Case Diagram, you can download it directly from the Team13_Requirements folder submission. The diagram is available in PNG format under the filename "RevisedUseCase.png," while the diagram file itself is named "RevisedP1.uxf." Our analysis led us to identify a total of 4 actors and 14 use cases, derived from a thorough examination of individual use case diagrams and a comprehensive group assessment. The Use Case diagram is presented as an image.

For a deeper comprehension of our project, we have also furnished descriptions for each use case. These descriptions were thoughtfully distributed among group members to ensure comprehensive coverage. Lastly, we've incorporated a snapshot of our Bitbucket Statistics to showcase the active involvement of everyone in the project.</p>
