        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="tab"></span> In Project 1, we focused on developing the data processing software for Chocoholics Anonymous. It's important to note that our scope did not encompass the communications software, terminal design, or managing payments between members and providers. Each team member, except for the project submitter, has contributed an HTML file containing their respective use case diagram and team information. This collective effort ensures alignment on the project's content. Erik Iverson is the project submitter.

            In terms of our glossary, we meticulously defined and clarified terms based on the Chocoholics Anonymous documentation and our Use Case Diagram. The latter was collaboratively created, incorporating input and insights from all group members. You can access the Use Case Diagram by downloading it from the links below or directly from the Team15_Requirements folder submission. The diagram is available in PNG format as "UseCaseDiagram.png," and the diagram file is named "UseCaseDiagram.uxf." Our analysis led us to identify 5 actors and 14 use cases, which were determined through an examination of individual use case diagrams and a comprehensive group assessment. The Use Case diagram is presented as an image, along with a delightful chocolate illustration.
            
            For a deeper understanding of our project, we've also provided descriptions of each use case. These descriptions were distributed among the group members to ensure comprehensive coverage. Lastly, we've included a snapshot of our Bitbucket Statistics to showcase everyone's active participation in the project.
